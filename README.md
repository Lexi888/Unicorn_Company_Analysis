# Unicorn Company Analysis
### Private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022, including each company's current valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns. In the first part of our analysis, we will try to answer following questions:
* Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment?
* How long does it usually take for a company to become a unicorn? Has it always been this way?
* What's the trend over time in the companies that became unicorns in the year2021 and the difference between the previous year?
* How many companis that joined unicorn per week?
* What's the most popular industry, and where are they located?

### In the second part of our analysis, we are more focused on the three top unicorn investors. The fundamental techniques used are: `input validation` and `label encoding`.
#### Benefits of using 'label encoding`:
- Label encoding changes the data by assigning each category a unique number instead of a qualitative value.
- Label encoding is effective when there are a large number of categorical variables and when the variables have a particular order. It is useful in machine learning models, such as decision trees and random forests.

## Key takeaways from this dataset:
- There are 1074 unicorn companies represented in this dataset.
- 2015 is the year when the most number of unicorn companies were founded. 
- Many of the unicorn companies that were founded in 2021 were founded in the United States and belong to "Fintech", "E-commerce & direct-to-consumer", and "Internet software & services" industries. 
- The box plot created shows that companies that become unicorns in the months of September and October have a smaller median value for how long it took to become unicorns.
- One of the bar plots created shows that the average valuation of companies that joined in 2020 is highest in the third quarter of the year, whereas the average valuation of companies that joined in 2021 is highest in the first quarter of the year.
- The three industries most commonly invested in by the top unicorn investors are: internet software and services, fintech, and e-commerce and direct-to-consumer.

## Based on the findings, we can share several recommendations with people who are  interested in investing firms:
- According to data analysis that was conducted on a dataset of 1074 unicorn companies, companies that joined in the months of `September` and `October` tended to take less time to become unicorns.
- Another finding was that many of the unicorn companies that were founded in 2021 were founded in the **United States** and belong to **"Fintech", "E-commerce & direct-to-consumer", and "Internet software & services" industries.** So if the stakeholders want to invest in companies founded in 2021, it would be a good idea to consider companies that belong to these industries, as they may be strong candidates for becoming unicorns.
- It was also discovered that the average valuation of companies that joined in 2021 is highest in the first quarter of the year, and the average valuation of companies that joined in 2020 is the third quarter of the year. When considering companies that newly join in the future, it would be worth closely looking at companies that join in the first and third quarters of the year.
