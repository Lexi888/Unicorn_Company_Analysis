## Based on the findings, we can share several recommendations with people who are  interested in investing firms:
- According to data analysis that was conducted on a dataset of 1074 unicorn companies, companies that joined in the months of `September` and `October` tended to take less time to become unicorns.
- Another finding was that many of the unicorn companies that were founded in 2021 were founded in the **United States** and belong to **"Fintech", "E-commerce & direct-to-consumer", and "Internet software & services" industries.** So if the stakeholders want to invest in companies founded in 2021, it would be a good idea to consider companies that belong to these industries, as they may be strong candidates for becoming unicorns.
- It was also discovered that the average valuation of companies that joined in 2021 is highest in the first quarter of the year, and the average valuation of companies that joined in 2020 is the third quarter of the year. When considering companies that newly join in the future, it would be worth closely looking at companies that join in the first and third quarters of the year.
